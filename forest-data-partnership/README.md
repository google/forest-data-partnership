# Forest Data Partnership

This repository contains code, model and other artifacts from the 
[Forest Data Partnership](https://www.forestdatapartnership.org/).  
The Forest Data Partnership aims to halt and reverse forest loss from 
commodity production by collaboratively improving global monitoring and 
supply chain tracking and accelerating restoration. It aligns partners 
around the data and ensures access for stakeholders across sectors to consistent, 
validated open-source geospatial forest-risk commodity data. The result is credible, 
systematic monitoring, verification and accountability towards progress in reducing 
commodity-driven deforestation and restoring degraded lands.

## Models

Coming soon!

Downloadable TensorFlow models are available in the `/models` directory.

The `host_model.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to host a model and connect
to it from Eartyh Engine.
